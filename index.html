                            was a Neogranadine seamstress who spied for the Revolutionary Forces during the Spanish Reconquista of the Viceroyalty of New Granada. 
                            She was captured by Spanish Royalists and ultimately executed for high treason.
                            The Day of the Colombian Woman is commemorated on the anniversary of her death. 
                            She is now considered a heroine of the independence of Colombia.

                    <p class="card-text">Pola was born on January 26, 1795 in the municipality of San Miguel de Guaduas, Viceroyalty of New Granada. 
                      Her given name varies in different versions, some say she was named Apolonia, Polonia or Policarpa. 
                      She was raised in an affluent family that moved to live in Santafé de Bogotá in 1797. 
                      In 1802, a smallpox epidemic caused the death of her father, mother, and two siblings. After the tragedy, the family dissolved and Policarpa lived in Guaduas with her older sister until she got married. 
                      During this period, Policarpa worked as a seamstress and some claim she taught at the public school. She shared with her family the patriotic spirit in times of war, and her brother-in-law and brother participated in the campaigns of the hero Antonio Nariño. 
                      There is no clarity about her full and precise name, but she is best known as Policarpa Salavarrieta or "La Pola". (From <a id="tribute-link" href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policarpa_Salavarrieta" target="_blank" class="card-link"><cite>Wikipedia</cite></a>)</p>

                    <p class="card-text">On November 10, 1817, the Council of War condemned her to death along with Sabaraín and several other patriots. It is said that La Pola cursed the Spaniards relentlessly throughout the night before her execution. 
                      At one point, tired and thirsty, she stopped, and one of the guards offered her a cup of wine. 
                      She threw the glass back at her captors, proclaiming, 'I wouldn't accept a glass of water from my enemies!' 
                      The hour and date set for the execution by firing squad was nine o'clock on Friday, November 14, 1817.(From <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policarpa_Salavarrieta" target="_blank" class="card-link"><cite>Wikipedia</cite></a>)</p>

                    <p class="card-text">The image of Policarpa has been used several times on Colombian banknotes and coins and is one of the only historical female figures to have appeared on them
                      (although other female figures have been represented, they are symbolic or mythological, such as Justice, Liberty, an anonymous Native American indigenous woman, the protagonist of Jorge Isaacs' novel Maria). 
                      In 2016, she gave up her place on the 10,000 Colombian peso banknote to anthropologist Virginia Gutiérrez.(From <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policarpa_Salavarrieta" target="_blank" class="card-link"><cite>Wikipedia</cite></a>)</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Policarpa Salavarrieta is considered by many historians of this period to be the most representative woman of the Colombian independence revolution. 
                      Her execution for a political crime moved the population and created great resistance to the regime imposed by Juan Sámano. While many women were also killed during the Spanish occupation, La Pola's case captivated popular imagination. 
                      Her death inspired poets, writers, and playwrights to immortalize her story, always highlighting her bravery and courage.
                      In honor of her commemoration, on November 9, 1967, the Congress of the Republic of Colombia passed Law 44, signed by President Carlos Lleras Restrepo,
                      declaring November 14 as "Colombian Women's Day" in honor of "Our Heroine, Policarpa Salavarrieta"(From <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policarpa_Salavarrieta" target="_blank" class="card-link"><cite>Wikipedia</cite></a>)</p>
